# Customer Support AI Agents - Multi-Agent System

## Project Overview
This project is a **multi-agent AI-powered customer support system** built using **CrewAI**. It features two AI agents who works collaboratively:

1. **Senior Support Representative** 
   - Handles customer queries by scraping data from the website(we need to provide the proper website) and responds.
   - Uses a **language model (LLM)** to generate answers.

2. **Support Quality Assurance Specialist** 
   - Reviews responses generated by the **Senior Support Representative**.
   - Can **delegate responses back to Senior Support Representative for improvement**.
   - Ensures accuracy, helpfulness, and professionalism before sending the final response.

cd Multi-AI-Agent-CustomerSupport
```

### **Install Dependencies**
Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** installed, then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Set Up API Keys**
- This project requires **Hugging Face** or **OpenAI API keys**.
- **Create a `.env` file** and add your API keys inside:
  ```
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here
  SERPER_API_KEY=your-serper-api-key-here
  ```

### **Run the Jupyter Notebook**
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
- Open **`customer_support.ipynb`** and execute the cells to see the AI agents in action.

## How It Works
This system simulates an **AI-powered customer support workflow**:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **A customer submits a query** (e.g., "How do I reset my password?").
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Senior Support Representative (AI) generates a response**.
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Support Quality Assurance Specialist (AI) reviews the response**.
4Ô∏è‚É£ If needed, the QA Specialist **delegates back** for improvement.
5Ô∏è‚É£ The final response is **sent to the customer**.
